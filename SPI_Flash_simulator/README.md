# SPI Flash Simulator

Used to Simulate a MX25L25635FMI-10G SPI Flash chip for Differential Power Analysis on an ARM M3 bootrom via effecting ciphertext in the Initial Program Loader loaded from flash.

Can be easily modified to load any small flash image depending on block ram availability.

Commands will need tweaking along with chip ID replies in top-level parameters.
